I'm a software engineer and CTO of Blank. I'm originally from Croatia and have spent over a decade building software.

My career started in traditional web development, but I became fascinated with blockchain technology during the early Ethereum days. I dove deep into smart contracts, DeFi protocols, and the promise of decentralized systems.

At Blank, I lead technical architecture for Web3 and AI products. I work with founders who want to move fast but refuse to compromise on security or quality. Most of what I do is proving that speed and quality can coexist-shipping production-ready products without accumulating technical debt.

I've built NFT platforms, DeFi applications, and smart contract systems across multiple chains. More recently, I've been focused on AI-powered tools. One of my current projects is totebot.ai, an AI platform that combines conversational AI and e-commerce.

Outside of work, I'm a trail runner and cyclist. Running teaches me lessons that code never could - about persistence, presence, and the value of showing up even when motivation fails.

I'm a proud girl dad and try to balance building the future of technology with being present for what matters most.

I'm always open to discussing new projects and ideas.
