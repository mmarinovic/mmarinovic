## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome 

I'm a CTO at [Blank](https://nft.blankhq.co/), a company that turns ideas into digital experiences.

Blank is a collaborative team of developers, designers, and product specialists working across various industries.

My responsibility at Blank is to ensure that our deliveries are of the highest quality and that our engineers have opportunities to work on different projects and hone their skills.

I'm hands-on with all of our projects, overseeing software architecture, reviewing pull requests, and guiding the projects in the right direction. My goal is to ensure clients feel safe.

Let me know if you need help building software in either the Web2 or Web3 industries, and we can discuss it!

My [X](https://twitter.com/0xMarko) DM's are open.
